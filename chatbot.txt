Bieber released his debut studio album My World 2.0 in 2010. Containing the hit single "Baby", the album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, making Bieber the youngest solo male act to top the chart in 47 years.[6] Following his debut album and promotional tours, he released his 3D biopic-concert film Justin Bieber: Never Say Never, which was a box office success. In the years after the releases of the Under the Mistletoe (2011) and Believe (2012), Bieber had established himself as a teen idol, but faced several controversies, including run-ins with the law internationally before his first arrest in 2014.[7]

Following the controversies surrounding Bieber, his sound became more mature as he transitioned into EDM and moved away from teen pop.[8] Released in 2015, his fourth studio album Purpose became his most commercially successful album, spawning three Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles: "What Do You Mean?", "Sorry", and "Love Yourself". After the release of Purpose, Bieber had featured on several successful collaborations, including "Cold Water", "Let Me Love You", "Despacito (Remix)", "I'm the One", "I Don't Care" and "10,000 Hours". After taking some time off to refocus on his marriage to American model Hailey Baldwin, Bieber released his fifth studio album, Changes, which became his seventh chart-topper in the US.

Bieber has sold more than 150 million records, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists.[9][10] He has won numerous awards, including a Grammy Award, 15 American Music Awards, 20 Billboard Music Awards, two Brit Awards, a Latin Grammy Award, a record 21 MTV Europe Music Awards, and three MTV Video Music Awards.[11] Time magazine included Bieber in their 2011 edition of the 100 most influential people in the world list. He was included by Forbes list of the top ten most powerful celebrities in the world, in 2011, 2012 and 2013.[12] In 2016, Bieber became the first artist to surpass 10 billion total video views on Vevo.[13]

Early life
Bieber was born on March 1, 1994, in London, Ontario, at St Joseph's Hospital,[14] and was raised in Stratford, Ontario.[15] He is the only child of Jeremy Jack Bieber and Pattie Mallette, who were never married.[16] Mallette was underage when she gave birth, and her mother Diane and stepfather Bruce helped her raise her son.[17] Bieber's ancestry includes French-Canadian, Irish, English, Scottish, and German.[18][19][20] He has also stated that he has some undetermined Aboriginal Canadian ancestry.[21]

Through his father Jeremy, Bieber has three younger half-siblings. Jeremy and his ex-girlfriend Erin Wagner, who broke up in 2014 after seven years together, have two children, daughter Jazmyn and son Jaxon.[22] Jeremy married his girlfriend Chelsey in February 2018, and they have a daughter named Bay.[23][24] Bieber also has a stepsister named Allie, the daughter of his stepmother.[25] Pattie worked a series of low-paying office jobs, raising Bieber as a single mother in low-income housing. Bieber has maintained contact with his father.[26]

Bieber attended a French-language immersion elementary school in Stratford, the Jeanne Sauvé Catholic School.[17] Growing up, he learned to play the piano, drums, guitar, and trumpet.[15][27] He graduated from high school in Stratford, Ontario, the St. Michael Catholic Secondary School in 2012[28] with a 4.0 GPA.[29] In early 2007, aged 12, Bieber sang Ne-Yo's "So Sick" for a local singing competition in Stratford and was placed second.[27][30] Mallette posted a video of the performance on YouTube for their family and friends to see. She continued to upload videos of Bieber singing covers of various R&B songs, and Bieber's popularity on the site grew.[31] In the same year, Bieber busked shows in front of Avon Theatre steps during tourism season.

Career
2008–2009: Career beginnings and My World
When searching for videos of a different singer, Scooter Braun, a former marketing executive of So So Def Recordings, clicked on one of Bieber's 2007 YouTube videos by accident.[26] Impressed, Braun tracked down the theatre Bieber was performing in, located Bieber's school, and finally contacted Mallette, who was reluctant because of Braun's Judaism. She remembered praying, "God, I gave him to you. You could send me a Christian man, a Christian label!", and, "God, you don't want this Jewish kid to be Justin's man, do you?" However, church elders convinced her to let Bieber go with Braun. At 13, Bieber went to Atlanta, Georgia, with Braun to record demo tapes.[26] Bieber began singing for Usher one week later.[32]

Bieber was soon signed to Raymond Braun Media Group (RBMG), a joint venture between Braun and Usher.[33] Justin Timberlake was also reportedly in the running to sign Bieber but lost the bidding war to Usher.[33][34]

Usher then sought assistance in finding a label home for the artist from then manager Chris Hicks, who helped engineer an audition with his contact L.A. Reid of The Island Def Jam Music Group.[35] Reid signed Bieber to Island Records in October 2008 (resulting in a joint venture between RBMG and Island Records) and appointed Hicks as executive Vice-President of Def Jam, where he could manage Bieber's career at the label.[3][31][33][35] Bieber then moved to Atlanta with his mother to pursue further work with Braun and Usher.[33] Braun became Bieber's manager in 2008.[31]

Bieber's first single, "One Time", was released to radio while Bieber was still recording his debut album.[36] The song reached number 12 on the Canadian Hot 100 during its first week of release in July 2009[31] and later peaked at number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States. During fall 2009, it had success in international markets.[37] The song was certified platinum in Canada and the US and gold in Australia and New Zealand.[38][39][40] His first release, an extended play entitled My World, was released on November 17, 2009. The album's second single, "One Less Lonely Girl", and two promo singles, "Love Me" and "Favorite Girl", were released exclusively on the iTunes Store and charted within the top 40 of the US Billboard Hot 100.[37]

"One Less Lonely Girl" was later also released to radio and peaked within the top 20 in Canada and the US, and was certified gold in the latter.[37] My World was eventually certified platinum in the US and double platinum in both Canada and the United Kingdom.[41][42] To promote the album, Bieber performed on several live shows such as mtvU's VMA 09 Tour, European program The Dome, YTV's The Next Star, The Today Show,[43][44] The Wendy Williams Show, Lopez Tonight, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, It's On with Alexa Chung, Good Morning America, Chelsea Lately, and BET's 106 & Park. Bieber also guest starred in an episode of True Jackson, VP in late 2009.[45]

Bieber performed Ron Miller and Bryan Wells's "Someday at Christmas" for US President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama at the White House for Christmas in Washington, which aired on December 20, 2009, on US television broadcaster TNT.[46] Bieber was also one of the performers for Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest, on December 31, 2009.[47]

2010–2011: My World 2.0 and Never Say Never
Bieber was a presenter at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards on January 31, 2010. He was invited to be a vocalist for the remake of "We Are the World" (a song written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie) for its 25th anniversary to benefit Haiti after the earthquake. Bieber sings the opening line, which was sung by Lionel Richie in the original version.[48]

On March 12, 2010, a version of K'naan's "Wavin' Flag", recorded by a collective of Canadian musicians known as Young Artists for Haiti, was released. Bieber is featured in the song, performing the closing lines.[49]

In January 2010, "Baby" was released from his debut album My World 2.0. The song featured Ludacris, and became an international hit. It charted at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100, peaked at number three on the Canadian Hot 100[50] and reached the top ten in several international markets.[37] Two promo singles, "Never Let You Go" and "U Smile", were top thirty hits on the US Hot 100, and top twenty hits in Canada.[37] According to review aggregator Metacritic, the album has received generally favourable reviews.[51] It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, making Bieber the youngest solo male act to top the chart since Stevie Wonder in 1963.[6] My World 2.0 also debuted at number one on the Canadian Albums Chart, Irish Albums Chart, Australian Albums Chart, and the New Zealand Albums Chart[37] and reached the top ten of fifteen other countries.[52][53]

To promote the album, Bieber appeared on several live programs including The View, the 2010 Kids' Choice Awards, Nightline, Late Show with David Letterman, The Dome and 106 & Park.[54] Sean Kingston appeared on the album's next single "Eenie Meenie".

On My World 2.0, Bieber's voice was noted to be deeper than it was in his debut EP, due to puberty.[63] In April 2010, the singer remarked regarding his vocals: "It cracks. Like every teenage boy, I'm dealing with it and I have the best vocal coach in the world ... Some of the notes I hit on "Baby" I can't hit any more. We have to lower the key when I sing live."[64] Bieber guest-starred in the season premiere of the CBS American crime drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, which aired on September 23, 2010. He played a "troubled teen who is faced with a difficult decision regarding his only brother", who is also a serial bomber. Bieber was also in a subsequent episode of the series, which aired on February 17, 2011, in which his character is killed.[65] Bieber performed a medley of his singles "U Smile", "Baby", and "Somebody to Love", and briefly played the drums, at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, 2010.[66] Bieber announced in October 2010 that he would be releasing an acoustic album, called My Worlds Acoustic.[67] It was released on November 26, 2010 in the United States and featured acoustic versions of songs from his previous albums, and accompanied the release of a new song titled "Pray".[68]

A 3-D part-biopic, part-concert film starring Bieber entitled Justin Bieber: Never Say Never, was released on February 11, 2011, directed by Step Up 3D director Jon M. Chu. It topped the box office with an estimated gross of $12.4 million on its opening day from 3,105 theatres.[69] It grossed $30.3 million for the weekend and was narrowly beaten by the romantic comedy Just Go with It, which grossed $31 million.[70] Never Say Never reportedly exceeded industry expectations, nearly matching the $31.1 million grossed by Miley Cyrus's 2008 3-D concert film, Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert, which holds the record for the top debut for a music-documentary.[71] Never Say Never grossed a total of $98,441,954 worldwide.[72] The film is accompanied by his second remix album, Never Say Never – The Remixes, released February 14, 2011, and features remixes of songs from his debut album, with guest appearances from Miley Cyrus, Chris Brown, and Kanye West, among others.[73] One song from the album, "That Should Be Me (remix)", featured with American country band Rascal Flatts, won him his first award in country music for Collaborative Video of the Year in CMT Music Awards in June 2011. Time magazine named Bieber one of the 100 most influential people in the world on their annual list.[74] In June 2011, Bieber was ranked No. 2 on the Forbes list of Best-Paid Celebrities under 30. He is the youngest star, and 1 of 7 musicians on the list, having raked in $53 million in a 12-month period.[75] The same month, his collaborative single "Next to You" with American singer Chris Brown has released. The unfinished video for that song was leaked online on June 6, and the official video was released on June 17. On November 1, 2011, Bieber released the Christmas-themed Under the Mistletoe, his second studio album. It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, selling 210,000 copies in its first week of release.[76] The first single from the album, "Mistletoe" peaked at number one on the US Billboard Holiday Digital Songs chart.[77] Bieber re-recorded Mariah Carey's single "All I Want For Christmas Is You" with Carey as well for the album.[78]

2012–2014: Believe, Journals, and other appearances
In late 2011, Bieber began recording his third studio album, entitled Believe. The following week, Bieber appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show to announce that the first single would be called "Boyfriend", and was released on March 26, 2012.[79] The song debuted at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, selling a total of 521,000 digital units, the second-highest-ever debut digital sales week.[80] Bill Werde of Billboard noted that it failed to debut at number one because the digital download of the track was available only through the iTunes Store, "restricting the buying option for those [who] do not frequent the Apple retail store".[81] "Boyfriend" became Bieber's first single ever to reach the top position on the Canadian Hot 100 by debuting at number one and staying on for one week.[80] Bieber was featured on American hip hop group Far East Movement's song "Live My Life", from their fourth studio album Dirty Bass, in February 2012. The song emerged online five days before its scheduled release date and peaked within the top thirty of the Billboard Hot 100.[82] The first promotional single from the album, "Die in Your Arms", was released on May 29, 2012 and the second promotional single, "All Around the World" featuring American rapper Ludacris, followed the next week.[83][84] The second single from Believe, "As Long as You Love Me" featuring rapper Big Sean, was released on June 11, 2012. It peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100.[85]

His third studio album, Believe, was released on June 19, 2012 by Island Records. The album marked a musical departure from the teen pop sound of his previous releases, and incorporated elements of dance-pop and R&B genres.[86] Intent on developing a more "mature" sound, Bieber collaborated with a wide range of urban producers for the release as well as some long-time collaborators, including Darkchild, Hit-Boy, Diplo, and Max Martin. Entertainment Weekly praised Bieber's musical shift, calling the album both a "reinvention and a reintroduction".[87] Rolling Stone noted the deeper voice and more "intense" beats found on the album, although it lampooned one of his euphemisms for newfound sexual maturity ("If you spread your wings, you can fly away with me").[88] Believe debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, becoming his fourth number-one album.[89][90][91] The album sold 57,000 copies in its first week in Canada, debuting atop the Canadian Albums Chart.[92] In September 2012, Bieber was featured on "Beautiful", a song from Carly Rae Jepsen's second studio album, Kiss (2012).[93] In October 2012, the third single from Believe, "Beauty and a Beat" featuring rapper Nicki Minaj, was released. The music video held the record for the most video views in 24 hours when it was released, with 10.6 million views.[94]

The Believe Tour, which further promoted the album, began in September 2012 in Glendale, Arizona.[95] On December 14, 2012, Bieber appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where he announced plans to release an acoustic album titled Believe Acoustic, which was released on January 29, 2013.[96]

Bieber returned to Saturday Night Live as the host and musical guest on the February 9, 2013 episode. His appearance was panned by critics[97][98] and cast members, including Kate McKinnon, who said Bieber was not comfortable with his hosting duties, and Bill Hader, who said he did not enjoy the presence of Bieber or his entourage. Hader added that in his eight years on the television program, Bieber was the only host who lived up to his reputation.[99][100]

On March 7, 2013, Bieber fainted backstage at London's O2 Arena after complaining of breathing problems throughout his concert performance and was taken to the hospital.[101] Bieber cancelled his second Lisbon, Portugal concert at the Pavilhão Atlântico, which was to be held on March 12, because of low ticket sales. The concert held in the same venue on March 11 did go on as scheduled.[102] In mid-August 2013, a remixed duet version of Michael Jackson's previously unreleased song "Slave to the Rhythm", featuring Bieber, leaked online.[103] In response to criticism over this remix, the Michael Jackson Estate stated that it had not authorized the release of this recording, and has since made attempts to remove the song from as many web sites and YouTube channels as possible.[104] Later, a song titled "Twerk" by rapper Lil Twist, featuring Bieber as well as Miley Cyrus, also leaked.[105] In September, Bieber was featured in Maejor Ali's song "Lolly" with rapper Juicy J.[106] A music video for "Melodies", the debut single of American singer Madison Beer, was released in the same month featuring Bieber in a cameo appearance.[107]

On October 3, 2013, Bieber announced that he would release a new song every Monday for 10 weeks as a lead-up to the film Justin Bieber's Believe, which entered production in May 2012 and was released on December 25, 2013. The film is a follow-up to Bieber's first theatrical film Justin Bieber: Never Say Never, with Jon M. Chu returning as director.[108][109][110] The first song of Music Mondays, "Heartbreaker", was released on October 7. The second song, "All That Matters", was released on October 14, followed by "Hold Tight" on October 21, "Recovery" on October 28, "Bad Day" on November 4, and "All Bad" on November 11. The seventh song, "PYD" featuring R. Kelly, was released on November 18; it was followed by "Roller Coaster" on November 25, and "Change Me" on December 2. The final song, "Confident" featuring Chance the Rapper, was released on December 9, 2013. That same day, it was announced that all 10 tracks will be featured on an upcoming collection called Journals. It reportedly featured five additional unreleased songs, a music video for "All That Matters", and a trailer for Believe. Journals was only available for purchase via iTunes for a limited time only: from December 23, 2013, to January 9, 2014. The titles of the five new additional songs are: "One Life", "Backpack" featuring Lil Wayne, "What's Hatnin' " featuring Future, "Swap It Out", and "Memphis" featuring Big Sean and Diplo.[111] Bieber released a song titled "Home to Mama" featuring Australian singer Cody Simpson in November 2014.[112] The same month, Bieber topped Forbes magazine's Forbes 30 Under 30 annual ranking, which lists the highest-earning celebrities under 30 for that year.[113]

Because of the disbanding of Universal Music's division, The Island Def Jam Music Group, in April 2014, Bieber and a number of artists were subsequently transferred to another Universal Music-related division, Def Jam Recordings, causing Bieber to no longer be signed to Island Records.[114][115]

Artistry
Musical style
Michael Jackson performing
Bieber has credited musicians such as Michael Jackson as his biggest influence
Bieber's music is mainly pop and R&B.[161] In 2010, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone asserted that the content of his music was "offering a gentle introduction to the mysteries and heartaches of adolescence: songs flushed with romance but notably free of sex itself".[162] In January 2012, Bieber told V magazine that he doesn't want to sing about sex, drugs and swearing. He stated "I want to do it at my own pace. I don't want to start singing about things like sex, drugs and swearing. I'm into love, and maybe I'll get more into making love when I'm older. But I want to be someone who is respected by everybody."[163] But since then, Bieber gradually altered his artistry, with Peter Gicas of E! Online describing "PYD" as "sexed-up", while In Touch Weekly magazine describing his song with Maejor Ali and Juicy J "Lolly" might make his fans a bit uncomfortable because of its lyrics.[164][106] After his hit in 2015 on Jack Ü's track "Where Are Ü Now", Bieber released the EDM-fuelled album Purpose a collaboration with Diplo, DJ Snake and Major Lazer.[165]

Influences
Bieber has cited Michael Jackson, The Beatles, Boyz II Men, Mariah Carey, Justin Timberlake, Stevie Wonder, Tupac, and Usher as his musical inspirations.[166][167][168] Believe was influenced by Timberlake, for which Bieber was trying to "create a new sound that people aren't really used to hearing ... like when [Timberlake] did FutureSex/LoveSounds: It was a new sound… acoustic guitar over hard drums."[169]

Voice
Bieber initially sang with a boy soprano voice,[170] before his voice broke, as was evidenced during the debut performance of "Pray" at the 2010 American Music Awards. Sean Michaels of The Guardian described puberty as "the biggest threat to his career" at the time.[171] Jody Rosen commented that Bieber sings with "swing and rhythmic dexterity" on his debut album, noting his tone to be "nasal".[162]

Bieber started to receive voice coaching from Jan Smith in 2008.[172]

As an adult singer, Bieber's voice type is tenor, with a vocal range spanning from the baritone A (A2) to the high tenor F (F5).[173][174] In a review of his Purpose album, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph complimented his "soft, supple and seductive singing."[175] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian also praised Bieber's "affectedly breathy voice", noting that "the voice soon palls, but the songs are often interesting."[176]

Business ventures and endorsements
In 2010, Bieber signed a deal with Proactiv.[177] In the same year, Bieber partnered with Nicole by OPI to launch a nail polish line "The One Less Lonely Girl Collection", which sold exclusively in Walmart.[178] Bieber's nail polish line sold one million bottles less than two months after its release.[179] Bieber endorsed Adidas, beside Derrick Rose and Venus Williams, in 2012.[180] He became the new "face" and "body" of Calvin Klein in early 2015.[181] In June 2015, Bieber teamed up with StarShop, a new shopping app launched by Kevin Harrington.[182] In January 2015, Entertainment Tonight reported that entertainer Justin Bieber had used MYO-X, a dietary supplement, in preparation for a Calvin Klein underwear photo shoot.[183] Bieber was criticized for "... hyping the latest 'miracle' supplement MYO-X, to his 59 million Twitter fans."[184] Bieber endorses Beats By Dre, Elizabeth Arden and Best Buy.[185][186] Bieber has been credited with boosting the careers of other singers such as Carly Rae Jepsen and Madison Beer when he tweeted about them.[187][188]

He has bandwagoned four fragrances as of 2014.[189] He launched his debut fragrance, Someday, in 2011;[189] it grossed more than three million US dollars in sales, at Macy's, in just under three weeks, which industry experts regard as a successful celebrity-led launch.[190] On the heels of that 2011 best-seller, he launched his second fragrance, Girlfriend, in June 2012.[191] His third fragrance, The Key, was launched in July 2013,[192] and his latest fragrance, Justin Bieber Collector's Edition, launched in 2014. In September 2019, after a year long collaboration with Schmidt's Naturals CEO, Michael Cammarata, Bieber released his deodorant line, "Here +Now."[193][194][195]

Public image
General

Bieber has been referred to as the "Prince of Pop"[196] and "King of Teen Pop"[197] by contemporary journalists. Usher commented that while he and Bieber were both signed at the same age, "I had the chance to ramp up my success, where this has happened to Bieber abruptly". As a result, when he was younger, Usher, Braun, Bieber's bodyguard, and other adults surrounding Bieber constantly coached him on handling fame and his public image.[26] After signing Bieber, Usher appointed one of his former assistants, Ryan Good, to be Bieber's road manager and stylist. Good, once nicknamed Bieber's "swagger coach", created a "streetwise look" for the singer which consisted of baseball caps, hoodies, dog chains, and flashy sneakers. Amy Kaufman of The Los Angeles Times comments, "Though a product of a middle-class suburban upbringing in Stratford, Ontario, Bieber's manner of dress and speech ('Wassup man, how you doin'?' or 'It's like, you know, whateva' ') suggest he's mimicking his favourite rappers."[198] In 2013, Bieber said he was "very influenced by black culture", but he neither thought "of it as black or white" nor tried to "act or pose in a certain way". To him, it was "a lifestyle—like a suaveness or a swag".[199] Wax statues of him with the hairstyle from his earlier career are on display at the Madame Tussauds wax museums in Amsterdam, London, and New York City.[200]

He's the only person in humanity who's grown up the way he has – with smartphones and cameras on him 24/7 ... Another kid can go out and have a good night on the town, and no one gives a crap, but Justin is the most Googled person on the planet – for four years straight!
—Scooter Braun, Bieber's manager, in 2013[199]
Bieber was often featured in teen magazines, such as Tiger Beat,[26] and has been labelled as a "teen heartthrob".[201] In 2010, he was frequently criticized for looking and sounding younger than his age,[202] and the following year for an androgynous appearance, which had been commonly noted in the media, including his appearance on the cover of LOVE magazine's androgyny issue in 2011.[203] His teen-pop music, image (especially as a heartthrob to girls), and the media attention he receives have additionally been criticized.[202] He has been a target of Internet bloggers and message board posters, especially users of the Internet message board 4chan and of YouTube.[204] Nick Collins of The Daily Telegraph said that "Bieber's character appears to strike a particularly sour note with his Internet critics" who have questioned his manner of speech, among other things.[202]

In his later years, especially after his marriage in 2018, Bieber's persona changed. As his fan base got older and he got married, Bieber transitioned away from the teenage heartthrob image, taking on a more mature personality and a more soft-spoken style of speech.[205][206] In an interview with Vogue in February 2019, Bieber said that he would "laugh at his past self".[207]

YouTube and Twitter
Bieber's early fanbase developed on YouTube and predated the release of his debut album My World.[208] According to Jan Hoffman of The New York Times, part of Bieber's appeal stems from his YouTube channel. Chicago Tribune noted that Bieber's fanbase, "Beliebers", was among the top words of 2010.[209] Long before the November 2009 release of My World, his YouTube videos attracted millions of views.[26] Braun recognized the appeal. Before flying him to Atlanta, Braun wanted to "build him up more on YouTube first" and had Bieber record more home videos for the channel. "I said: 'Justin, sing like there's no one in the room. But let's not use expensive cameras.' We'll give it to kids, let them do the work, so that they feel like it's theirs", recalled Braun.[26] Bieber continues to upload videos to the same channel and has opened a Twitter account, from which he interacts with fans regularly;[31] his account was reported to have more than six million followers in November 2010.[210] Bieber surpassed Lady Gaga for being the most followed person on Twitter in January 2013. In early November 2013, Katy Perry surpassed him for having the most followers.[211]

As of 2017, Bieber was the second most followed user of Twitter, while his VEVO channel made him the third most subscribed user of YouTube until by 2018 where it became the second most subscribed user of YouTube. The music video for Bieber's song "Baby" is the second most disliked on YouTube, receiving over 9.93 million dislikes since its upload in 2010, being only surpassed by the 2018 YouTube Rewind in December 2018.[212] Guinness Book of World Records listed "Baby" as the most disliked video on YouTube and on the Internet as of 2013[213] and six of Bieber's music videos (more than any other artist) listed in the top 40 most disliked videos on YouTube.[214] Bieber was frequently a trending topic on Twitter when the feature first launched[215] because his fans frequently discussed him on the network,[216] and he was named the top trending star on Twitter in 2010;[217] Klout gave his account a score of 100.[218][219] In April 2013, the social media analysis company Socialbakers concluded that 16.7 million of Bieber's 37 million Twitter followers were not genuine.[220][221]

Personal life
As Bieber resides in the United States, he is reported to possess an O-1 visa for temporary resident status, based on "extraordinary ability or achievement" in a field.[222] Bieber has said he is not interested in obtaining US citizenship, and has praised Canada as being "the best country in the world", citing its mostly government-funded health care system as a model example.[223] However, in September 2018, TMZ reported that Bieber had begun the process of becoming an American citizen, following his marriage to Hailey Baldwin.[224]

Relationships
Bieber's father, Jeremy Bieber, is a former carpenter and pro-am mixed martial artist. In March 2014, Rolling Stone characterized Jeremy as having "split with Justin's mom when Justin was a toddler, and wasn't always around afterward. But he has, as of late, accepted a place of honor in his superstar son's entourage".[225]

In December 2010, Bieber began dating Selena Gomez.[226] After initially splitting in November 2012, they had an on-again, off-again relationship until March 2018.[227][228][229] On an interview during The Ellen Show, Bieber stated that hit songs including "Sorry", "Mark My Words", and "What Do You Mean?" are about his relationship with Gomez.[230]

Bieber became engaged to Hailey Baldwin on July 7, 2018.[231] They had briefly dated from December 2015 to January 2016 before splitting, then reconciled in May 2018. Bieber and Baldwin reportedly obtained a marriage license in September 2018,[232] leading to reports that they had a civil marriage.[233] On September 14, 2018, Baldwin stated on Twitter that she and Bieber had not yet married, but deleted the tweet afterward.[233] On November 23, 2018, Bieber stated he was married to Baldwin.[234] Bieber and Baldwin had an official ceremony in Bluffton, South Carolina on September 30, 2019.[235]

Beliefs
Bieber has described himself as a faithful adherent of Christianity, said he communicates with God via prayer, and that "He's the reason I'm here".[236] He reflected his faith in a music video with Brandon Burke, titled "#iPledge", in which he talks about God's forgiveness.[237] Bieber was baptized on January 9, 2014 by Pentecostal pastor Carl Lentz of Hillsong Church, New York, after a born again experience. He has described Lentz as a good friend.[238][239] When asked how he wants to raise his children, Bieber said, "I'm a Jesus follower. When you accept Jesus, you walk with the holy spirit. I just want to be led by the holy spirit."[240] Many of Bieber's tattoos have religious significance including the medium-sized cross on his chest and a tiny cross under his eye. Bieber also covered up the "Son of God" text tattooed on his abdomen with a large design that features two angels, gothic arches, a skeleton and a serpent.[241]

Regarding sexual abstinence, Bieber told music magazine Rolling Stone in 2011, "I don't think you should have sex with anyone unless you love them." He added that he does not "believe in abortion", and that it is "like killing a baby". When asked about the case of abortion with regard to rape, however, he said, "I guess I haven't been in that position, so I wouldn't be able to judge that."[223][242] His view on sexual orientation is quoted as "everyone's own decision",[243] and he has contributed to the It Gets Better Project,[244] a non-profit group aiming to prevent suicide among LGBT youth.[245]

Philanthropy
Bieber supports Pencils of Promise,[246] a charity founded by Adam Braun, the younger brother of Bieber's manager. The organization builds schools in developing countries, and Bieber became manager for the organization's campaign in Guatemala. He serves as a celebrity spokesman for the organization[247] by running ads for the charity and its campaign "Schools4All".[248][249] He promises to visit schools that donate the most funds to the organization.[250] He takes part in the charity's fund-raising galas and donates parts of the proceeds from his concerts and Someday line of fragrances,[251] and various merchandising to the charity. He also appears in an animal welfare PSA for PETA encouraging people to volunteer at and adopt from animal shelters instead of buying pets from breeders or pet stores.[252] In 2013, Bieber launched his online #GiveBackPhilippines campaign for helping the victims of Typhoon Haiyan and travelled to the Philippines after raising $3 million.[citation needed] His work in the country earned him a star on the Philippine Walk of Fame.[253] He also supports Children's Miracle Network Hospitals and Alzheimer's Association.[254][255]

Bieber and Ariana Grande collaborated on the single "Stuck With U", released in May 2020 as the first of series of singles coordinated by entertainment executive Scooter Braun, who is also Bieber's manager, to support the COVID-19 pandemic.[256] All net proceeds from the song went to the First Responders Children's Foundation to fund grants and scholarships for children of first responders and health care workers who worked on the front lines during the pandemic.[257]

Legal issues and controversies
Bieber had several run-ins with the law around the world before his first arrest in 2014,[258] including when he was accused of reckless driving in his neighbourhood in 2012, and charged in Brazil with vandalism in 2013.[258][259] One of his neighbours in Calabasas, California, accused Bieber of throwing eggs at his home on January 9, 2014, and causing thousands of dollars of damage.[258][260][261] On January 23, 2014, Bieber was arrested in Miami Beach, Florida, together with singer Khalil, on suspicion of driving under the influence (DUI), driving with an over six month expired license, and resisting arrest without violence.[259][262][263] Police said that Bieber told authorities he had consumed alcohol, smoked marijuana, and taken prescription drugs.[258] He has been released from these charges on a $2,500 bond.[264] A toxicology report revealed that Bieber had THC (a principal constituent of cannabis) and the anti-anxiety medication Xanax in his system at the time of his arrest.[265][266]

Following Bieber's arrest on the DUI charge, more than 270,000 people petitioned the White House seeking to have him deported from the United States. Although the number of signatures received was sufficient to require a response under published White House guidelines, the Obama Administration declined substantive comment on the petition.[267] Immigration Law expert Harlan York noted that the likelihood of Bieber being deported was extremely slim. York stated, "About a decade ago, the Supreme Court ruled that driving under the influence, typically, is not a basis to deport someone."[268]

On July 9, 2014, Bieber was charged with one misdemeanour count of vandalism in California for throwing eggs at his Calabasas neighbour's home in January.[261][269][270] Police earlier claimed that they had video footage of him high-fiving friends after the eggs were thrown.[261][271] With him pleading no contest to the charge, the Los Angeles County Superior Court sentenced him on July 9 to pay US$80,900 in restitution, serve two years' probation, complete twelve weeks of anger management, and five days of community service in what the district attorney termed a negotiated settlement. Since then, he has permanently moved to Beverly Hills, California.[261][269][270]

On August 13, 2014, the January DUI case was settled with a plea bargain; Bieber pleaded guilty to resisting an officer without violence and a lesser charge of driving without due care and attention. He was fined US$500 and sentenced to attend a 12-hour anger management course and a program that teaches the impact of drunken driving on victims. As part of the plea bargain, he made a US$50,000 contribution to Our Kids, a local children's charity.[272][273]

I didn't want to come off arrogant or conceited, or basically how I've been acting the past year, year and a half ... although what's happened in the past has happened, I just want to ... be kind and loving and gentle and soft.
—Bieber reflects in a video posted in January 2015[274]
On September 1, 2014, Bieber was arrested and charged with assault and dangerous driving near his hometown of Stratford, Ontario, after a collision between a minivan and Bieber's all-terrain vehicle on August 29. Ontario police said that he then "engaged in a physical altercation" with an occupant of the minivan. He was released shortly and his lawyer blamed the incident on "the unwelcome presence of paparazzi".[275][276] On September 8, Toronto dropped an assault charge against him originally brought up on January 29 for an incident with a limousine driver in December 2013.[277][278] In November 2014, he was ordered to appear in Argentina within 60 days by a Buenos Aires court to give testimony on an alleged assault on a photographer on November 9, 2013.[279] When he failed to do so, an arrest warrant was issued and two of his bodyguards were released in Argentina in April 2015.[280]

In June 2014, a video emerged of a 15-year-old Bieber telling a joke about black people, which used the word "nigger" multiple times.[281] In the same month, a second video showed a 15-year-old Bieber giggling as he croons his song "One Less Lonely Girl", but parodying the main lyric as "One less lonely nigger", and stating that if he were to kill one, he would be "part of the KKK".[282][283] He apologized the day the latter was released: "Facing my mistakes from years ago has been one of the hardest things I've ever dealt with."[284]

In July 2017, the Chinese government banned Justin Bieber from performing in China. A Chinese Bieber fan reached out to the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture requesting the reason for the ban. The Bureau released a statement, explaining "Justin Bieber is a gifted singer, but he is also a controversial young foreign singer", and "In order to maintain order in the Chinese market and purify the Chinese performance environment, it is not suitable to bring in badly behaved entertainers."[285][286]

In June 2020, Bieber was accused of sexual assault by an anonymous woman, merely known as "Danielle", who claimed on Twitter that the singer had made non-consensual sexual acts at a Four Seasons hotel in Austin, Texas in March 2014 while with then-girlfriend Selena Gomez.[287] The woman claimed that she had been inspired to tell her story by Twitter user 'itsgabby', who had accused actor Ansel Elgort of sexual assault the week prior.[288] In a series of tweets, Bieber denied all the allegations stating that sexual abuse "is something I don't take lightly", providing evidence that he wasn't present in the alleged location within the said time that the alleged incident took place proving that he was innocent.[289] He further said that his team would be taking legal action against the accuser, whose Twitter account and statement had disappeared shortly after Bieber had responded to the claim.

Health
Bieber has struggled with mental health issues,[290] particularly depression and anxiety,[291][292] at various points during his career.[293] He has generally been open about these issues.[294][295]

On January 8, 2020, on his Instagram, Bieber announced that he was diagnosed with Lyme disease, saying that speculation by other people that he looked like he was on drugs was false. He also revealed that he has infectious mononucleosis, which affected his neurological and overall health.[296][297]

Achievements

Throughout his career, Bieber has sold an estimated 150 million records as of 2019[298] and is one of the best-selling music artists globally.[299] In 2011, Bieber was honoured with a star in front of Avon Theater in Stratford, Ontario, Canada, where he used to busk when he was younger. On November 23, 2012, Bieber was presented with the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal by the Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper. He was one of 60,000 Canadians to receive the Diamond Jubilee medal that year.[300] In 2013, Bieber received a Diamond award from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) to recognize his single "Baby" as the highest-certified digital song of all time (record later broken by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's "Despacito").[301][302] Bieber has earned ten Grammy nominations (including one win),[303][304][305] two Brit awards,[306][307] six NRJ Music Award nominations (Bieber won four awards out of six nominations, but he has six awards because he was honoured twice with special awards),[308][309][310] nineteen Billboard Music Awards,[311] and numerous fan voted accolades which include fifteen American Music Awards and[312] twenty three Teen Choice Awards.[313] He also has won twenty one MTV Europe Music Awards (one is a special award), which is the most awards received by a single artist to date.[314]

On November 13, 2015, the release of Purpose marked his sixth album to debut at number one. He also became the first artist, since Elvis Presley in 2005, to replace his own song as number one on the UK Singles Chart.[315] As of 2016, Bieber has received fourteen titles in the Guinness World Records, which include eight that were achieved from the success of his album Purpose and was featured in the 2017 Edition. These records included the most streamed track on Spotify in one week, the most streamed album on Spotify in one week, the most simultaneous tracks and most simultaneous new entries on the US Billboard Hot 100 by a solo artist, the first act to occupy all top three positions simultaneously on the UK Singles Chart, the most followers on Twitter by a male, the most viewed music channel on YouTube by an individual, and the most subscribers on YouTube for a musician by a male.[316]

Bieber was included among the top ten in The Highest-Paid Celebrities Under 30 annual list in the world by Forbes magazine. He has been listed six times in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017.[317]

"Steps to Stardom", an exhibit on Bieber's early career, opened in his hometown of Stratford, Ontario in February 2018 at the Stratford Perth Museum, offering a collection of mementoes from his formative years and rise to international stardom.[318] The items on display include a professional drum kit he owned as a younger child, his Grammy Award, microphones, his Stratford Warriors hockey jacket, and personal letters, including one from Michelle Obama.[318] Bieber made a number of visits to the museum.[319][320] "Steps to Stardom" was originally scheduled to close in October 2018 but board of the museum extended its stay for at least another year after the exhibit broke attendance records set by its Anne Frank House exhibit in 2015.[321]
